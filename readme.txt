The AddThis Social Sign In plugin allows visitors to easily register/login to your WordPress site with their favorite social networking sites Facebook, Twitter or Google.  In addition, visitors will save time by registering with their favorite social network because their profile will automatically be populated from their existing Facebook/Twitter/Google profile.  And visitors won't have to setup and remember another password. When they return to your site, they simply click on one of the login methods and will automatically be logged-in.
